# Virtual-access-card-website
Level 1-Task 3-Codveda

A digital acess card interface. This project highlights the intersection of secure identity and innovation.

## Goal
It was built to showcase the possibility to handle instant data display using basic javascript on an html and css webpage.

## Technology stack

* **HTML5:** Used for the webpage's basic skeleton.
* **CSS:** Used styling properties to add innovation  to the webpage, and mostly played a huge role in the creation of the card and barcode, using svg, as well as making sure that the website is well orientated and even the dynamic data sits well.
* **Javascript:** Used to handle the dynamic user data, unique access ID creation, date of issue creation, aswell as the barcode creation.

## Challenges
Making sure that the website is well orientated after the dynamic data displayed
Unique barcode creation, that matches the automatically generated access ID and ensuring that it displays well inside the card

## Lessons learnt

Using the latest CSS properties because the ancient ones have their downfalls when trying to align them with modern technology.E.g using high pixels to move items only for them to be disorientated when something more advanced is added.
